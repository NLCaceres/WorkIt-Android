# Work It for Android

## First for iOS, Now for Android ##
Seeing how my iOS version turned out, I immediately figured it would be great practice to try and implement
an Android version. As more projects came my way and my schedule got busier, I let this project fall to the wayside. 
With more time and much more experience under my belt, I think it's time to get the Android version going

## Future Changes ##
 - Build up the entire app
    - Get Google Maps API to implement location services (Google Play Location Services will help)
    - Google Play Location Services
    - Profile Section
    - Google Firebase Login
    - Workout Log
    - Custom Exercises
    - Check if can access phone step counter
